Algorithem :

1. for i=1 to n in steps of 1 and j=1 to n+1 in steps of 1 do read aij end for.
2. Read e, maxit
	Note: e is the allowed relative error in the result vector. maxit is maximum number of iterations allowed for the solution to converge.
3. for i=1 to n in steps of 1 xi=0 end for
4. for itr=1 to maxit do
	big=0
5. for i=1 to n in steps of 1 do
	sum=0
6. for j=1 to n in steps of 1 do
7. for (j≠i) then sum =sum+aijxj end for
	temp=(ai(n+1)-sum)/aii
	relerror=|(xi-temp)/temp|
8. if relerror > big then big=relerror
	xi=temp
	end for
9. if (big<=e) then
	begin Write ‘converges to a solution’
10. for i=1 to n in steps of 1 do Write xi endfor
	stop end
	end for
	Write ‘Does nott converge in maxit iteratioins’
11	for i=1 to n in steps of 1 do Write xi end for
12. Stop
