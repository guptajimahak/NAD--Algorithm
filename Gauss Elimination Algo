System equcation Ax=b that is matrix form

Where as,
A = Coefficient Matrix,
X = variables (Column Matrix),
b = constants (Column Matrix.

Step 2: Find Augmented Matrix C = [ Ab ]

Step 3: Transform Augmented Matrix into Upper Triangular Matrix.


Step 4:  Find equations corresponding to upper triangular matrix.
Now by using back Substitution reconstruct the equations and find the corresponding values of the variables x, y and z.

1.x + 1.y + 1.z = 6
0.x – 2y + 0.z = – 4
0.x – 0.y + 2z = 6

Therefore,

x + y + z = 6
-2y = -4
2z = 6

Now, Put the value of y and z into eq. 1.
X + 2 + 3 = 6 –> x = 1
Therefore, the roots of the three equations are x = 1 , y = 2, z= 3
